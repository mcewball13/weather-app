## Description

This weather app works by allowing the user to input a city name in plain english, it will then conver the city name into lat and lon and pull the required data from the Open Weather public API. It will then update the data onscreen with the current weather data as well as the 5 day forcast. Some of the UI elements change base on the current weather, like the background image and the 5 day icons. Once they have checked their city name they can then check another or come back at a later time to find their most recent city name saved in localstorage and shown on screen.

## Technologies used

This app was build with mainly Jquery. Using some HTML and CSS to polish it up. We pulled from the Open Weather API for the weather data.
